## Squidventures 2: Inked out of Orbit!
### Background info
This is Group 11's project for Software Engineering.

Our project is a game developed in C# with the Unity Engine and will use procedural generation to make an environment similar to an alien asteroid field, complete with plants and (possibly) animals.
### Story (?)
You are a Squid-like character who has crashed into an asteroid field. Your spaceship is damaged, and your only hope to get home is to find all the broken pieces of your spaceship and repair it.
### Contributing
For this project, we will be employing the Git Feature Branch workflow.
[Check here for a guide.](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
Each feature branch should correspond to a card on the Trello. After you have reviewed and tested your code, submit it for a pull request so we can merge it into main.

***Please do not commit changes directly to main, send a pull request first so we can review and test each branch.***
