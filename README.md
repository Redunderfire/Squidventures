## Squidventures 2: Inked out of Orbit!
### Background info
This is Group 11's project for Software Engineering.

Our project is a game developed in C# with the Unity Engine and will use procedural generation to make an environment similar to an alien asteroid field, complete with plants and (possibly) animals.
### Story (?)
You are a Squid-like character who has crashed into an asteroid field. Your spaceship is damaged, and your only hope to get home is to find all the broken pieces of your spaceship and repair it.
### Contributing
For this project, we will be employing the Git Feature Branch workflow.
[Check here for a guide.](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
Each feature branch should correspond to a card on the Trello. After you have reviewed and tested your code, submit it for a pull request so we can merge it into main.
### Building
To build this project, clone the repo and add it as a project in Unity Hub.
From there you can build by clicking "File" and then "Build".
This should lead you to a page where you can select your build platform and build for it.
### Credits
We are using a heavily modified version of the Marching Cubes algorithm from Sebastian Lague. [Here is his repo.](https://github.com/SebLague/Marching-Cubes)
His code is licensed under the MIT license, which can be found [here.](https://mit-license.org)
All other code (that is not inherent to the Unity Engine) was created by our team.

***Please do not commit changes directly to main, send a pull request first so we can review and test each branch.***
